# Google Play Store Apps Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Google Play Store Apps dataset. We cleaned the data and used visualizations to identify app attributes that strongly correlate with the number of Installs (our target variable). The project concludes with a Logistic Regression model trained to classify an app's potential for high installation success.

## Key Libraries Used
